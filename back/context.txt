On the second tab of this interface, the user is able to create any image he wants by writing a prompt of it.
The prompt has to be a description of the picture he wants. The IA will then generate the image and display it. The user
will finally be able to download the image. The generation can take up to 5 minutes to be done. And the prompt has to be
written in english. The IA is able to generate images of any kind, but it is better to write a detailed prompt to get a
better result. Secondly, the IA is able to identify the content of an image. The user can upload an image and the IA
will display the identified content of the image.
